                After collaborating to discuss and highlight the key
                similarities and differences in our career plans, it was clear
                that after our course at RMIT, our paths quickly separated in
                terms of further learning and career advancement. Although we
                all continued on with higher education, only Blayne and Michelle
                chose to further gain certificates within their field to help
                boost their skill sets. Helia decided to take an alternative
                approach and train herself physically and lingually to be able
                to perform her best in her ideal job. All three of us took
                earlier entry roles to gain required experience towards our
                ideal role.
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>
                Both Blayne and Helia were required to dramatically relocate to
                achieve their ideal jobs, as it would not be viable otherwise.
                Blayne and Helia achieved their ideal job at around the same
                year, while Michelle took a couple years longer due to wanting
                to gain administrative experience before gaining general IT role
                experience.

              The overall consensus of our group is that we collaborated and
              engaged with each other quite well. This was demonstrated by the
              ease with which we were able to participate in tasks with others
              members, whether it was in group settings or one on one. We had
              regular meetings, both formal and informal, which enabled us to
              become more than a group of strangers, to feel like friends in
              such a short amount of time. It felt like everyone was willing to
              help each other out, even outside of their assigned sections; this
              helped the group&apos;s efficiency, and collaboration skills and
              helped ease the pressure off of those with busier schedules. We
              were transparent with each other from start to finish, openly
              discussing our A1 marks and suggestions as well as when it came to
              agreeing to contributions, we had everyone speak about the
              contribution percentages they gave themselves and as a group we
              spoke about why we agreed or disagreed with their self-analysis.
              Our contribution percentages, at the end of Assignment 1 were not
              decided based on strict word limits and times applied to tasks, we
              adapted to each other well and came to an agreement that suited
              us.

              As well as we worked together, some members ended up voluntarily
              completing some tasks that were not within their scope of tasks,
              leading to some feeling like more effort was put in on their
              behalf and others feeling left behind. For this assignment, we aim
              to discuss prior commitments and work schedules more in-depth to
              assign more appropriate sections to prevent some from falling
              behind and prevent other members from waiting around due to having
              more time than the rest.

            <span>
              We as a group have decided to care more about available time than
              contribution workload, meaning we would rather assign members with
              better-suited sections for the personal skills and time available.
              We are hopeful that this will lead to better quality content with
              less stressed members. Making sure each person is submitting 33%
              exactly is not how we plan to move forward with this assignment.
              Quality over quantity is our motto. As we get closer to the
              submission date we will be implementing daily check-ins so we do
              not leave things until the last minute like we had some members do
              the last assignment. As three of our members have chosen to leave
              the course, we aim to help each other even more than we already do
              in terms of check-ins, collaborations and feedback suggestions. We
              are confident that despite our bad luck with half of our group
              deciding to leave, we can accomplish what we can to the same level
              of depth and effort that we did during A2.

            Taking a DISC test for a second time in this assessment period was a
            good test of how my personality or attitude towards my group has
            changed. As I was doing the test I felt as though some of my
            responses had changed, and did in fact feel like my general attitude
            had also changed. The result said otherwise, as I had the same
            outcome as my first test 6 weeks ago, if not slightly more biased
            towards the Stabiliser type from the Editor type. Although the
            results do not indicate much of a change, I can confidently express
            my enjoyment that I’ve had working and socialising with my group.
            Beginning the group work I felt quiet and reserved toward the team,
            and I’m sure some recognised that. However over time I felt as
            though my personality gained some confidence and my attitude towards
            group work changed to accommodate enjoyment of relying on others and
            having them rely on me.

            It was surprising to see how my DISC test result had changed the
            second time around. To be honest I knew my test result was going to
            be different when I noticed myself selecting different answers
            compared to the previous time I did the test. I think the way the
            group&apos;s relationship has changed since the beginning of A2 has
            definitely made a huge impact on me as well. In the beginning I was
            super lost and didn’t think I was capable of doing much but as more
            time went by I surprised myself on how much i was actually capable
            of! I’m super grateful to work along such an amazing team. We all
            set pretty high standards for ourselves and will help each other as
            much as we can to achieve the best results. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

            It surprised me to see that my DISC test has changed since the start
            of this assignment although I did notice when repeating the test
            that my thoughts on the questions themselves were different. I found
            myself answering in response to how I am with this group now, unlike
            at the start where I would answer as how I would be in a potential
            future group. I find my thoughts on group work have changed entirely
            throughout these assignments and I only have my amazing team mates
            to thank for that. We work insanely well together and the remaining
            three of us are super detail oriented and always pushing for “better
            than perfect”, it’s really nice to contribute with such like minded
            people. It’s our inside joke that we scared off the other three due
            to our commitment and dedication to being the best. I’m really happy
            and comfortable knowing I can rely on my teammates and I hope that
            they feel the same towards me too.

              We were all pretty excited to start A3 given how well we worked
              together, aside from communication issues and meeting deadlines we
              didn’t have any other concerns stepping into A3 until we were
              informed by Jake that he was going to drop out of the course due
              to personal issues. Jake’s announcement to leave was a shock to
              all of us as he was one of the top contributors and had a big
              impact on A2, but we didnt let this bring us down, we were still
              pretty excited about A3, we started our planning and meetings for
              A3 during this time Burak was not attending nor communicating with
              all of us, so we were kind of prepared that he might also be
              dropping out, as our meeting went by we were all becoming more
              excited as we all came up with some pretty great ideas, but
              unfortunately one day Charlie messaged our group chat and informed
              us that he was dropping out of the course, not shortly after Burak
              also informed us that he is also dropping out, so within a week we
              lost 3 members and became a 3 member group trying to an assignment
              that should be done by at least 4 people. We felt quite
              overwhelmed by the amount of work that needed to be done, but with
              those members dropping out all of our concerns regarding
              communication and meeting deadlines was solved. Those 3 members
              dropping out was a big shock to us as we thought we all worked
              pretty well together and collectively were excited for A3 but life
              gets in the way and everyone has their own matters to tend to. It
              all worked out great in the end as Michelle, Blayne and Helia have
              had a blast working on A3 together.
            </span>
            <br />
            <span></span>
            <br />
            <span>
              In the initial weeks of A3, with Jake having dropped from the
              group, Charlie, Blayne, Helia and Michelle worked hard to plan out
              the project as a whole. The idea for the presentation involved a
              self animated skit involving Blayne presenting his application
              idea alongside Jake, an imaginary friend, in front of a panel of
              judges. After the sudden withdrawal of both Charlie and Burak, the
              remaining group kept this idea as the lead. After some thought and
              a few weeks of not having made much progress, the idea was
              scrapped in favour of a different form of visual presentation, and
              slightly different story.
            </span>
            <br />
            <span>
              This new presentation idea involved Blayne presenting his
              application to two podcast hosts alongside a famous business
              owner. This was to be animated using the Sims 4, and matching up
              the voiceovers with character movements. This was deemed to be an
              easier alternative, while still delivering an informative and
              engaging piece of content.
            </span>
            <br />
            <span>
              With this presentation, as Michelle owned the Sims 4, she took to
              creating the characters with the guidance of Blayne and Helia.
              Michelle also created the podcast area, and proceeded with the
              animation of the characters to match up with the podcast
              voiceover. The voice overs were contributed to by the whole team,
              with each person voicing themselves. Helia recorded an extra piece
              in the form of ‘aggressive marketing’ herself.
            </span>
            <br />
            <span></span>
            <br />
            <span>
              Michelle and Blayne mostly kept the notes Google doc up to date,
              with Helia adding sometimes - we used this document during our
              meetings too as we screenshared it for the recording so that it
              helped our marker grasp the context of the things that we were
              saying. All meetings were attended by all three of the members,
              with everyone happy to push meetings back to suit timelines if
              needed. There were no issues during meetings, no issues about
              meetings. Everything went smoothly.
            </span>

            <span></span>
            <br />
            <span>
              Like A2, we stuck to two scheduled meetings a week with the
              allowance of any informal ones as we please. However, we also
              added a rule that towards the end of the assignment we would start
              having daily meetings to help keep each other sticking to
              deadlines, however once the other three dropped out we didn’t need
              to actually do this rule as us three stuck to our deadlines quite
              well to be honest. We had almost weekly informal meetings where we
              smashed out a ton of the project collaboratively. This was pretty
              much how the entire assignment was done and it worked insanely
              well for us. Even just sitting in silence as we all typed our
              assigned sections for the content we were working on for that day,
              it was nice to be able to talk about thoughts and create better
              content because you have other people to bounce your ideas off of
              in real time. Our meetings this time were short most times because
              we speak so often outside of our recorded meetings that there
              isn’t really a lot that we don’t already know during the recorded
              sessions. Which, for an outsider just looking at the recordings
              can seem like we aren’t contributing or working well together,
              however it&apos;s quite literally the opposite. Everything was
              done when expected, as expected and was always up to the high
              standards that we expected from each other. It’s been really nice
              to have a group of people who think alike and want to achieve the
              best and not just go for something that is ‘good enough.’

              Michelle and Blayne went over the rubric quite often to make sure
              that all of our content was on par with what was required of us.
              We also did this last assignment too and this definitely helped
              contribute to our high marking.

              In the above table, we have chosen to speak about the reason why
              our percentages are different or the things that we didn’t
              contribute as much / at all to, meaning that everything not said
              means that we 100% collaborated together on.
