                  Michelle was born at 9:13 am on 16th October 1993. She was an
                  only child until the age of two when her mother decided that
                  introducing a new child to their family was the best option,
                  and so her brother Chris was born. Shortly after Chris&apos;
                  birth, their dad left, and Michelle&apos;s mum was left to
                  raise two kids on her own. Not much of Michelle&apos;s
                  childhood can be recalled; she didn&apos;t see her dad again
                  until she was eight, and he had a new girlfriend.
                </span>
                <br />
                <span></span>
                <br />
                <span>
                  Around this time, Michelle was first introduced to computer
                  games. She fell in love with Age of Empires and Train
                  Simulator. Her grandfather gifted a computer to Chris and her
                  for Christmas one year. He taught Michelle all about what each
                  component does and how they all interact with one another.
                  Michelle got curious one day and pulled out the IDE cable,
                  wanting to know why it was so wide and flat and what it did -
                  breaking her computer&apos;s hard drive in the process. With
                  help from her grandfather, they fixed it together.
                  Michelle&apos;s father and his GF eventually get married, and
                  they also have two kids. Emma and Violet. Violet was born when
                  Michelle was 18, and Emma was born when Michelle was 20.
                </span>
                <br />
                <span></span>
                <br />
                <span>
                  Michelle enjoyed school until she entered high school, as it
                  was here that she started to struggle with mental health
                  issues and stopped applying herself well. She would later
                  regret this, but at the time thought that she knew what was
                  best. She instead focused more on playing games, mostly Call
                  of Duty, and stopped doing most activities that she had
                  previously enjoyed, like drawing and reading.
                </span>
                <br />
                <span></span>
                <br />
                <span>
                  When she was around 20, under a lot of peer pressure: Michelle
                  applied for a volunteer job at her local community centre. It
                  was here that she would transfer data from paper to digital,
                  something that she was surprised she enjoyed doing. She liked
                  how immersive and alone she felt when focusing on such a
                  mundane task. However, she did not stay long here as her
                  mental health issues got in the way, and she eventually
                  stopped going to work. Michelle instead chose to spend her
                  time playing games. Her favourite being Destiny 1 and Destiny
                  2. It would not be for another 7 years that Michelle actually
                  did something meaningful with her life. Meaningful in terms of
                  social standards. However, if you ask her, she had more fun in
                  the last couple of years than ever; but there was always
                  something missing. A desire to have something to do, a
                  schedule to follow, to be learning something.. To be
                  contributing.
                </span>
                <br />
                <span></span>
                <br />
                <span>
                  And so, 2022 arrives, and Michelle decides that with or
                  without mental health problems, she will apply herself in a
                  field that she really enjoys. This turned out to be one of the
                  best decisions of her life so far. She has thrived in this
                  environment, feeling happier to be doing something and
                  interacting with the people she has met. Michelle specifically
                  enjoyed Helia and Blayne&apos;s company the most as they were
                  all so alike in terms of humour and work efficiency.
                  Michelle&apos;s first year back of education thus far was a
                  great success. She was proud of herself for finally taking the
                  step to do something that she once felt would be impossible to
                  do. Michelle was excited for her future, a feeling she hadn’t
                  felt in a long time.

                <span>
                  Michelle decided that she wanted to go back to university
                  before getting some work experience and applied to University
                  of Melbourne to gain her Master of Information Technology,
                  where she chose to minor in law. She was granted a scholarship
                  through the Melbourne School of Engineering Foundation
                  Scholarship, awarding her $20,000 off her fees.

                  Michelle decided that she wanted to further her learning and
                  skills, specifically to become a database administrator and
                  went ahead and gained certifications for IBM, Microsoft and
                  Oracle. She knew that it was not required that she become
                  certified in all 3 of these, however she enjoyed learning and
                  took joy knowing that it was helping to make her a better
                  candidate for her future job.

                  Michelle decided that she needed to build some work
                  experience, as she had previously never had any, and applied
                  to be an Administrative Assistant at the Royal Melbourne
                  Hospital. After she was given the job, Michelle moved to
                  Melbourne and settled down in Parkville: so she was closer to
                  her work.

                  Throughout her time working at the Royal Melbourne Hospital,
                  Michelle took online courses to further develop her
                  understanding of computer programming and databases. Michelle
                  enjoyed programming with Java and would create applications
                  that she found niche uses for in her free time, never taking
                  this hobby commercial.

                  Michelle was ready to take further steps to become a Database
                  Administrator and applied for a job as a Data Entry
                  Administrator at Ventia. It was here that Michelle realised
                  she could thrive in a project manager position and would
                  periodically check for job listings that suited her, with this
                  never amounting to anything other than a ‘what if’ thought.

                  Michelle took some time off work to travel as she wanted to
                  experience the IT industry from another country; and went to
                  America and would tour companies that allowed her access. This
                  was beneficial to Michelle&apos;s career as it helped keep her
                  eyes on what she knew was her ideal job and allowed her to
                  broaden her knowledge and experience outside of a classroom
                  setting.

                  Michelle applied for a job listing to become a Database
                  Administrator at the Department of Jobs, Precincts and Regions
                  and was accepted. She enjoyed this position as it was heavily
                  cloud-focused, and cloud computing has always been
                  Michelle&apos;s field of interest. To help keep her up to date
                  on trends, Michelle would periodically take online courses
                  that would either be refreshers or introduce her to the
                  upcoming technological advances in cloud computing.
                  Eventually, Michelle was promoted to Senior Database
                  Administrator, and this was the job that she settled into
                  until retirement.

                  Throughout her career, Michelle found herself enjoying many
                  different aspects that the IT industry offers and found
                  herself loving programming and cloud computing the most. Upon
                  her retirement at age 65, Michelle would still periodically
                  dabble in programming; however, this was primarily just for
                  entertainment purposes.

                  Michelle was deep into learning how to create a program that
                  would improve her reading skills, as she wanted to be able to
                  enjoy books at a quicker pace. Michelle actually had achieved
                  quite a lot and was close to making a breakthrough when
                  suddenly she spontaneously self combusted. All over the media
                  there were reports of the grandma who caught fire, with most
                  believing it was a hoax or that somehow the computer caught
                  fire and that is how Michelle died. For those who knew her
                  however, the thought of her overworking herself to death was
                  not a new concept.

                  Michelle was loved by many and due to having no children of
                  her own, left all of her money to her cats and their future
                  generation of kittens. She had watched The Aristocats, so knew
                  that some people might want to harm her cats to gain access to
                  the money, so one of the clauses in her will was that 24/7
                  protection was to be provided to her cats and whichever of her
                  family that chose to look after them. And if anything were to
                  happen to all of the cats, or there were no more cats left to
                  give her money to - she wanted the remaining money to go to
                  the Royal Children&apos;s Hospital in Melbourne.

                  Coming into A3 I felt as if we would fly through this with
                  ease as I was sure we were getting a 90% on A2. I feel we
                  performed extremely well together in A2, with a lot of help
                  from myself and Blayne being the overseers making sure all
                  content flowed together well and was grammatically correct,
                  and read well. Jake was a big help in the leading department
                  too as he was usually down to do major tasks in collaborative
                  calls. So when Jake announced that he was leaving the course
                  on the first week we were starting A3, it was a major shock to
                  us. However, Charlie, Blayne, Helia and I would go on to joke
                  about Jake’s absence in the next group meeting and came up
                  with a presentation idea that revolved around Jake leaving and
                  Blayne ‘seeing and talking’ to Jake, even though no one else
                  can see him. While this was happening, Burak was non
                  communicative with us and wasn’t attending meetings - so we
                  contacted Anthony to get him involved, which ended up with
                  Anthony sending us all a message to reply to: to check up on
                  our participation. Burak did not reply to this, the rest of us
                  did however. The following couple of days, Charlie messaged
                  the chat randomly and said that he was also dropping out and
                  that he was sorry. Half an hour later, Burak finally contacted
                  us and said the same thing. So within the first two weeks of
                  A3, we were left to do the entire assignment as a three man
                  squad. However, I knew that we could do it due to us already
                  having planned out most of the project and the presentation.
                  So with this, the surprising thing for me is that our group
                  members dropped out - and something that worked well was our
                  resilience to push through the struggles and perform to our
                  best anyway. If there are any improvements to be made, I
                  couldn’t exactly pinpoint them as doing this assignment was a
                  breeze compared to the first one. All formality fell off and
                  it felt like I was doing work with legitimate friends and not
                  just classmates. I know I said this in the last reflection,
                  but it feels more comfortable now after 9+ weeks together. The
                  biggest takeaway for me during this entire course and working
                  with Blayne and Helia, is that I prefer to work with people
                  and not alone, as I previously had thought. It’s nice to not
                  feel like I’m studying alone and having only myself to rely
                  on. I’m really happy with the group that I formed and looking
                  forward to the future that we planned together. We have
                  scheduled our classes for the same times over the next year so
                  far.
