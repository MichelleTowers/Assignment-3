                    Our project will be an Android-based application aimed at
                    people who enjoy motorbikes and going to tracks. Our
                    application will use GPS tracking and telemetry data
                    gathering to show statistics of a user&apos;s session while
                    they are at a racetrack. We plan for users to access
                    features such as map view, allowing them to place markers on
                    the map overlay and create their own tracks using our
                    application. Personal statistics such as top speeds on
                    tracks, track completions and lap times will also be tracked
                    and displayed to the user when finishing a session, saving
                    to their personal profile afterwards.

                    We will be implementing social aspects via customisable user
                    profiles, forum boards and a follow feature. The user will
                    be rewarded trophies, badges and currency for reaching
                    specific criteria. We also want to promote inclusivity and
                    provide users with links to riding guides, gear
                    recommendations as well as news and articles relating to
                    motorbikes and the racing world. We will be implementing
                    safety features to prevent misuse, promote being safe while
                    driving and offer a way to alert medical assistance in
                    emergencies. Mostly we are hoping for users to utilise our
                    application alongside their favourite activities, enabling
                    the gamification of these activities by comparing statistics
                    with friends, family and other users on the application.

                    This application development could potentially present the
                    opportunity to be recognised in the higher racing
                    communities, such as MotoGP teams and personalities, with
                    more involvement with motorsports events and companies. This
                    could include sponsorships, competitions, discount codes,
                    meet and greet events and the opportunity to participate in
                    tuition lessons hosted by motorsport champions.

                    Our motivation for this project comes from a passion for
                    racing and competitiveness and a broad interest in the
                    racing, mechanical, advertising, social and leisure aspects
                    this application will provide. Our application is not aiming
                    to solve a problem; instead, we aim to provide motorbike
                    enthusiasts with a way to enhance their experience in such a
                    niche activity. Our application fits in well with current IT
                    trends as we aim to utilise Cloud Computing by using Google
                    Firebase to host and develop our mobile application. Our
                    application can be considered smart technology and a
                    potential IoT device, considering that it could be used in
                    conjunction with OBDII readers, computers and GoPro. Future
                    application potentials can utilise AI for our track
                    verification, estimated track statistics and allowing for
                    the opt-in automation of sharing statistics to another
                    profile that a user interacts with regularly. The benefits
                    of developing this application would show potential
                    employees our efficient teamwork, willingness to research
                    and report on topics more in-depth than what is required and
                    our eagerness to pick up new things and attempt to master
                    them to the best of our abilities. It will also demonstrate
                    our proficiency in mobile coding, databases and cloud
                    computing concepts and the ability to adapt to high
                    workloads in short timeframes.

                    The closest similar way to achieve this would be using a
                    buddy with a standard stopwatch timing you as you go around
                    the track, with him also writing down your lap times and
                    working out the average time himself based on known track
                    length. Applications similar to ours are RaceChrono, which
                    is a location logging and data analysis app designed for
                    motorsports, available in a very restricted free version or
                    a slightly expensive pro version priced at $28.99 on the
                    Google play store. Another similar app also found on
                    Google&apos;s play store called LapTrophy offers similar
                    functionality to RaceChrono at the price of $6.49 per month.

                    Our application Traqstarz will offer a more modern, cleaner
                    GUI with a more user-friendly layout than the existing
                    applications. We will incorporate better social aspects by
                    introducing user profiles, forum boards and the ability to
                    follow other users. Our application also includes safety
                    features such as app locking over certain speeds, emergency
                    assistance if accidents occur and offer engagement features
                    to keep users wanting to come back and use our application.
                    We will not be implementing the ability to extract telemetry
                    data from GoPro videos at this time, as well as not allowing
                    the reading of vehicle data using OBDII scanners, as
                    implementing this is not viable within the constraints of
                    our project. These are opportunities for us to expand, but
                    not features that we will be focusing on.

                    Our application aims to provide people with an accurate way
                    to track data and statistics about sessions at a race track
                    and enable a competitive and social aspect to niche
                    groups&apos; favourite activity all within their smartphone.
                    We want to enhance a niche group of people&apos;s experience
                    when doing one of their favourite hobbies. We hope that it
                    will help people make friends and engage in friendly
                    competition.

                    We will be designing wireframes for our application as it
                    helps us work out the look and flow of how the application
                    should be. Creating pages and goals for the user on each
                    page will help section out our application and know which
                    pages we should attempt to develop first or which are most
                    viable to develop.

                    want to do this as most of us are creative, and seeing how
                    the application could look in the future is exciting and

                    We need to develop the application, which we have chosen to
                    do using the open-source Python library named Kivy. Kivy
                    will enable us to integrate an android framework to develop
                    the application for Android devices. We have chosen Kivy
                    after looking into Google Firebase&apos;s built-in developer
                    programming languages.

                  <span>
                    We realised that it would be too unrealistic for us to begin
                    learning anything there and produce something workable in
                    such a short time frame, so the viable option is to stick to
                    Python as it is what we are learning in Intro to
                    Programming.

                    We will require access to the sensors of a mobile phone, as
                    this will be the critical component for our application to
                    work. We need to figure out how to pull data from these
                    sensors in either real time, or saved to a log and accessed
                    at a later time.

                    As we will be allowing users to view and edit tracks via
                    real world maps, we need to find a way to do this. We want
                    to add in this feature to create a way for users to add in
                    tracks that they personally use that not a lot of people
                    know about, thus allowing for the community vibe to spread.

                    We intend to have a start recording and stop recording
                    button so the user will be able to track all data within the
                    recorded session. We need it to only be within this session
                    for real time, reliable data so we will need to figure out
                    how to build a stopwatch in Kivy that stops and starts data
                    pulling.

                    One of our main concerns was safety, after some discussions
                    about how to achieve this, we decided that an emergency
                    contact message that sends out when the user is in danger
                    would be a good way to achieve this. We would have strict
                    rules on what ‘danger’ actually means, but we feel like this
                    would be helpful for our users and their families&apos; sake
                    and also provide another legal barrier for us to not be
                    liable.

                    Allowing users to create and edit their personal profiles is
                    essential for our application not only to develop a
                    community, as that is our theme, but to allow users to feel
                    personally connected to our application. Viewing others
                    profiles also adds to the social and competitiveness aspects
                    that we are developing our application towards.

                    Hosting a discussion board will be an excellent way for our
                    users to interact and gain knowledge from each other, as
                    people enjoy sharing their knowledge. Users can ask
                    questions when in need of assistance, or even post items for
                    sale. This will greatly increase involvement with the
                    application amongst users.

                    Disclaimers will have to be constructed and implemented to

                    Legal documentation and terms and conditions will also be
                    included, outlining data collection, developer and user
                    rights, intellectual property laws, and overall limit
                    liability of application owners/developers.

                    Testing the application will be a requirement to ensure a
                    standard of quality for users to be able to get the most
                    enjoyment that they can from using the application. Bugs
                    will be found and fixed, and features will be introduced or
                    removed as a result of extensive testing.

                    Collaboration in developing the application itself will
                    require developers to create/review and edit code with one
                    another. Committing code to Github on a regular basis is a
                    goal from our team to ensure efficient coding practices.

                    Before posting the application onto the Google Play store,
                    the application will need to be hosted using a hosting
                    service. Google Firebase is the key choice as it is free to
                    a limit that will not be reached with our small application.

                    We will be publishing our application on the Google Play
                    store, so we need to register and pay the fee for a Google
                    Play Developer Account. This allows us to target specific
                    audiences first before expanding to other platforms if we
                    ever decided to.

                    To market our application we would be creating a website
                    that shows off the features and explains why we decided to
                    create the application. We will also make posters that have
                    a QR scannable on them that will take the user to our
                    application website too. Users will also be able to share
                    the application to friends.

                    We are planning to make a mobile phone application. We are
                    focusing on an Android-only, Australian only application as
                    that seems feasible for us compared to expanding onto
                    multiple platforms and appealing to different laws and
                    regulations; a prominent example is the GDPR. As the GDPR
                    applies, even if a business is not hosted in Europe, we
                    would still need to consider all of their rules. The most
                    significant change we would have to make to adhere to the
                    GDPR would be making reasonable efforts to verify if our
                    user is a child or not, and if they are, if they had a
                    parental or guardian figure consent for them. We have
                    researched data and privacy laws in Australia, and we
                    learned that we do not need to require age limits for
                    Australian users as the Australian Privacy Act &apos;sets no
                    minimum age at which an individual can make decisions
                    regarding his or her personal information&apos; (ALRC, 2010.
                    para. 4)

                    However, because we will be collecting personal information
                    and data from users, we will be adopting a Privacy-By-Design
                    approach to our application. PDB means we will be
                    implementing good privacy practices into our design and all
                    decisions as we make the application. We will be
                    implementing a privacy policy for data collection, which
                    will include our registered company name, what data is being
                    collected, how it is used and where it is stored, the
                    reasons why we are collecting the information, how a user
                    can access their personal information or ask for a
                    correction or have their data deleted.

                  <br />
                  <span>We will be collecting the following data:</span>

                  <span>
                    - Location data - to enable the use of the geolocation

                  <span>
                    This data will be stored securely within our Google Firebase
                    database, using server-side encryption. This encryption is
                    &apos;256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard and each
                    encryption key is itself encrypted with a regularly rotated
                    set of master keys.&apos; (Google Cloud, n.d. para. 2) We
                    believe all of this will comply with the Australian Privacy
                    Act 1988.

                    We will also have a disclaimer and terms and conditions for

                    liability for external and internal misuse of our
                    application and any accidents and injuries to users using
                    our application. The disclaimer will state basic safety
                    instructions such as not riding under the influence and how
                    to use PPE correctly. The disclaimer will prompt the user to

                    Our application will be distributed via the Google Play
                    Store. Users will be able to download a free trial version
                    of our application or pay to subscribe to the full paid
                    version. Payments will be managed via Google Play&apos;s
                    billing system. Due to the price sensitivity of Android
                    application users, this is where a freemium subscription
                    model will be effective. Users will be able to try out our
                    application functionality, create a profile and track
                    unlimited sessions but with limited features. Only being
                    able to track speed and lap times, and seeing that there are
                    many more telemetry data options would lead to the user
                    wanting to record and display this data.

                  <span>
                    As this will be a ‘freemium’ service, some features will be
                    locked from the user, with a few main, usable features
                    available. When a session is begun, the user is prompted as
                    to which telemetry features should be recorded. The main
                    features available would be speed, lap time, and highest
                    acceleration value only for the session. The user would not
                    be able to record gyroscopic data such as lean angle,
                    highest and lowest acceleration at any point on the track,
                    total distance ridden and g-force. These options will be
                    ‘hard greyed out’, with no way to enable them.

                  <br />
                  <span>
                    Also disabled will be the option to view the speed and
                    acceleration overlays on the map. Where there are green and
                    red lines for acceleration and deceleration respectively,
                    there would instead be light and dark greys, making it
                    indistinguishable between the two but clear that there is a
                    difference between constant and changing velocity.

                  <br />
                  <span>
                    We considered locking out most tracks and only allowing a
                    few select tracks to be recorded using the application,
                    however thought this to be detrimental to the success of the
                    app. If a user wasn&apos;t allowed to ride at a track of
                    their choosing, they would not be inclined to change their
                    plans, and would not even get to test the app to see if it
                    was worth paying for it.

                  <span>
                    The application will have an option for users to utilise
                    auditory notifications while in use. These offer insight
                    into the data of current laps, split times, or simply
                    ‘motivational comments’. Each option that is available will
                    be toggleable by the user. These will be disabled with the
                    free version.

                  <span>
                    The application will include a page for users to browse gear
                    and tuition recommendations, with links to appropriate
                    sites. When the user selects the button to bring this page
                    on screen, they will be prompted with the option to
                    subscribe, with a list of the popular features they are
                    currently locked in the free version of the application.

                    This freemium model will allow the user to get a feel for
                    our application&apos;s benefits and ease of use. Once the
                    user reaches the maximum number of free tracking sessions,
                    they will be prompted to upgrade by signing up for a
                    subscription plan.

                    A trial/freemium pricing strategy is an effective way to
                    boost sales of a paid application because there is a trend
                    toward application developers shifting from charging a
                    one-off fee to a subscription model. We will be offering
                    users upgrading from the trial to the full version the
                    option to pay AUD 10.00 per month or to pay only AUD 8.00 a
                    month (a discount of 20%) if they opt for the annual
                    subscription paying AUD 96.00 per year.

                    We plan to host our application on Google Firebase utilising
                    their free but limited plan “No-cost spark plan”, which
                    allows up to 1GB of stored data and 50k reads/20k writes per
                    day. As we don’t think we would come close to reaching those
                    limits within our first couple of years after the
                    application launch, this is the perfect option. We will
                    still be able to do all that we plan to do, with greater
                    ease as Google Firebase offers an all-in-one solution to
                    application development with great coding, database and
                    hosting features. Google Firebase also has internal
                    maintenance features, including the ability to change and
                    optimise features without publishing a new version, thus
                    allowing us to beta test quite easily. One of the biggest
                    reasons we are choosing Google Firebase is that they allow
                    for you to test out machine learning capabilities which
                    would help us in the future design and features we have,
                    such as AI automated track verification. Google Firebase has
                    many inbuilt libraries that would help us to develop and
                    deliver the best version of the application that we have in
                    mind.

                    The core use of this application will centre around the
                    actual movement of the phone with the user. When the user
                    begins their session, the app will record relevant data
                    until the user stops the recording. The user would press a
                    &apos;start recording&apos; button to begin this session.
                    The user will be able to configure this option so that
                    recording begins immediately. As a default option, the user
                    can ‘arm’ the app by pressing a button. Recording would not
                    begin until some conditions have been met, such as certain
                    speed, location, or voice activation.

                    After the app begins recording and tracking telemetry data,
                    it would continue doing so until the user stops the bike and
                    presses the &apos;stop recording&apos; button or until a
                    condition has been reached. Some examples of conditions that
                    would be configurable are after a certain number of
                    successful laps around a track or a time limit. An average
                    amount of laps and time of the session on a recreational
                    ride day would be ~10 laps and ~15 minutes, and these would
                    be default values.

                    As users are required to use gloves when riding on a track,
                    this can be an impairment when operating the app. Most
                    android phones have an extra sensitivity function for when
                    users wear gloves. However, the app will not be allowed to
                    be used when the rider is in motion, only when the rider is
                    stopped. Therefore it is a given that riders will usually
                    remove gloves to operate phones. Adding to the subject of
                    the device used in motion, the application will have a
                    &apos;lockout&apos; mode that prevents the app from
                    interacting when it detects a speed above 6 kph. This speed
                    is set to allow the use of the app while walking, as 6 kph
                    is the average walking speed.

                    The application will have a feature allowing users to load a
                    map, with drag and zoom functions. The map will have street
                    names and colours for grass/buildings/roads/water, just as
                    most popular map applications do. The user will be able to
                    specify a single point on the map to save as a point of
                    interest which will be distinguished by a pin-like image
                    that indicates that specific point. Using the maps and pin
                    drop functions, the user can specify a specific pin such as
                    one dropped at the end of pit lane, that when passed the
                    recording would begin.

                    A map import and creation feature will be included. This
                    will allow the user to pick a track map out of a list or
                    search and import the map and included map points. This will
                    show the map as an overhead satellite view or map view, with
                    set pins indicating specific points of the map, such as the
                    start and finish of corners, straights, finish lines and
                    other key points of that track.

                    To allow the users to view and edit maps of tracks around
                    the world, we will be implementing the use of Kivy Garden’s
                    Mapview. Garden is a centralised collection of Kivy widgets,
                    referred to as flowers. Mapview is a flower that includes
                    support for custom maps and placing markers. Mapview
                    utilises OpenStreetMaps as the source for the maps. This is
                    an open source widget that works well in Kivy app
                    development.

                    The user will be able to drop extra pins where they like,
                    enabling data to be recorded as the user passes them and
                    allowing for more accurate data values calculated using
                    these points. These now custom maps can be uploaded/exported
                    for others to use. After a session, this track map will have
                    a visual element that indicates where the user was on the
                    track and at what time. Touching any part of this overlay
                    will bring up the &apos;lap choice&apos; menu, allowing the
                    user to see data about that point on specific laps. The
                    overlay will also indicate red for deceleration and green
                    for acceleration over the track.
                  </span>
                  <br />
                  <span>
                    The application will utilise the phone&apos;s GPS or an
                    external Bluetooth GPS to record the user&apos;s location
                    data. The app will be able to utilise this GPS data to
                    display where the user is and their previous locations on a
                    map. This will allow the user&apos;s speed to be determined
                    using distance/time maths. The top and average speeds will
                    be calculated for each session and each lap. The import and
                    creation of verified and custom track maps will be included
                    in the app. These maps will have specific points that
                    indicate turns, straights, and specific locations key to
                    each track to identify the track itself. As a user passes
                    these points, all data collected at that point will be
                    logged. Once the finish line point is passed, a new lap will
                    have started, and all data in that lap will be recorded as
                    the corresponding lap number. This will allow the user to
                    quickly see specific lap data without hunting through the
                    whole session data.

                  <span>
                    Accelerating values can also be calculated by tracking
                    distance, speed, and time. This feature will require a
                    higher polling rate GPS module to be accurate. The highest
                    and average acceleration and deceleration values will be
                    recorded for each lap and session and can be seen at any
                    point. Users will look for some vital information out of
                    corners and on the main straight. G-force is a data value
                    that can be pulled from a phone&apos;s gyroscopic sensors at
                    specific points, which users will want when braking and
                    accelerating. G-forces will show how much gravitational
                    force is on the rider as they make sudden changes in
                    acceleration and when cornering.

                    Many riders make the choice to install headsets within their
                    helmets, and it is becoming common for some manufacturers to
                    include this in the helmets that they produce. The user will
                    have the opportunity to utilise this by enabling the
                    ‘Auditory features’ option when configuring the session
                    recording.

                  <span>
                    This feature will allow voiceovers to give the rider
                    information about the current session, such as lap count and
                    upcoming corners. These would all be triggered by passing
                    certain locations (pin drops on the map). This feature will
                    also include information such as split times, new lap
                    personal bests, and general motivating comments such as
                    “Great job!”, and “Keep shredding!”.

                    If the user has a microphone in their helmet, saying “start
                    recording”, will do exactly that. Implementing these
                    features would require a ‘waiting for event’ function in the
                    code of the application, and also access to the microphone
                    along with location and telemetry data.

                    As an alternative to the user starting the application and
                    arming the recording, the option to automatically begin the
                    recording 20 seconds after the start button is pressed. This
                    will give the user time to press the button, store the
                    phone, check their jacket, gloves and helmet, and leave the
                    pits to reach the track.

                    We aim to make this application as user friendly as
                    possible, so people from all backgrounds and experiences
                    will be able to have a fun and engaging experience. There
                    will be social interactions within the app to achieve this
                    goal, such as allowing the user to sign up and create a
                    profile. Upon profile creation, we would like users to
                    choose an avatar that closely represents them and then
                    choose a vehicle type and model they own which makes the
                    experience for the user more personalised.

                    We plan to have the option for users to customise their
                    profile with stats displaying such as their fastest times or
                    top speeds at verified tracks. Users will also be able to
                    favourite tracks and leave reviews, which can be shown on
                    profile tabs. We will be implementing a follow option for
                    users to follow their friends or well-known users of our
                    application, with push notifications being an opt-in for
                    when someone a user follows is active on the app. This will
                    allow users to view the statistics available of other users
                    to compete or congratulate. We will also be implementing an

                    earned, such as &apos;fastest time overall on a track&apos;
                    and &apos;most completions overall on a track.&apos; Badges
                    will also be used, displaying badges like &apos;amount of
                    tracks created overall&apos; and &apos;amount of tracks
                    completed in a month.&apos; Users can post live streams or
                    recorded footage of themselves on tracks via Youtube. A
                    reporting feature will ensure that users do not post harmful
                    or violent imagery.

                    We want to include a discussion board because it will be an
                    excellent way for our users to interact and gain knowledge
                    from each other. We plan to implement this by using Google
                    Firebase to create a NoSQL document database that contains
                    collections for posts, comments, likes and dislikes. This
                    will be our backend.

                    For our front end, we will be utilising Angular, integrating
                    our backend with AngularFire. Using angular there are two
                    ways to receive new data from Firebase. These are calling
                    for the data, using ‘.get function’ or setting up a listener
                    to receive data change events. We will opt for the ‘.get
                    function’ to be used every 15 minutes, as we do not want to
                    risk reaching Firebase&apos;s ‘No spark plan’ request limit.
                    We will announce on the forum page that it is set to a 5
                    minute delay, so we are upfront and users aren’t confused
                    with delays. Users can use the forum board to post
                    questions, post ads for bike and gear sales, congratulate
                    mother users, recommendations for bikes/gear/tracks, and
                    other general communicative purposes.

                    In the future development of the application, more
                    specifically if we ever were to transfer to Google
                    Firebase&apos;s paid plan, we want to implement a forum
                    board for each verified track that will update every 5
                    minutes. This will allow users to easily chat to other users
                    at the same track, for example posting a message
                    communicating that they&apos;re in x garage riding x bike,
                    and to come say hi.

                    We want to welcome everyone who has a passion for racing. To
                    help our beginner racers, we decided to have a specific
                    section on tips and information on how to get started for
                    beginners and a News and Articles section. This information
                    could be helpful for everyone. We also want to include links
                    to gear and accessories for users to purchase, rider
                    training courses available to attend. This will be
                    implemented by providing a specific page for users to click
                    on images of helmets which will redirect to external web
                    pages of known websites with high customer ratings.

                    By incorporating external links to websites to purchase gear
                    and accessories, we will be able to make sure everyone
                    involved in our application will have the tools to be as
                    safe as possible. As the times change, so do gear standards
                    in terms of safety. In Australia, motorcyclists are required
                    to wear an approved helmet that adheres to the Australian
                    (AS1698 or AS/NZ1698) standard. Not only do these protect
                    from incidents, but by having shatterproof visors and
                    goggles, it creates a defence from rough weather, insects
                    and stones. Having links to purchase gear will encourage
                    users to ride as safely as possible, as user safety is a
                    priority for us.

                    For our news and article section we would use RSS feeds of
                    popular motorbike and motorsports and add them to our
                    application. We would not be using all of our articles and
                    news from just one site and we would make sure to properly
                    link to the original article as well as only provide
                    snippets of the articles on our news and articles page,
                    meaning when the user wants to read more they have to click
                    on an article and will be taken to the original source
                    article. RSS feeds will be implemented by simple HTML
                    hyperlinks to the feeds.

                    We will also be linking the website webbikeworld as it
                    aligns with the applications needs. Not only does it provide
                    gear and bike reviews. For example, a specific brand that
                    will be recommended as a base for your biking gear needs, is
                    Alpinestars. Recommending popular brands by association with
                    the website again confirms our focus on rider safety, as
                    having an accident on a motorbike can often result in major
                    injuries.

                    Blayne initially thought up our application in Assignment 1.
                    When our group came together to choose a project to work on,
                    we all chose another one to begin with. Towards the end of
                    Assignment 2, during a late-night call; Michelle, Blayne and
                    Jake spoke in depth about the lack of progress, ideas and
                    general knowledge of the project we all had chosen - and the
                    three then came up with a proposal of change for the
                    remaining members: the proposal included the idea of
                    swapping to Blayne’s application instead and spoke about new
                    features that we had thought of and had snippets of feedback
                    that Blayne had received for the idea as well as feedback
                    others had received from Luka. In the next meeting, the
                    group decided that we should swap the project to Blayne’s
                    application and thus, ‘Traqstarz’ was created. Later on in
                    that meeting: Blayne, Michelle and Helia were the only
                    members still in the call as it had been well past the end
                    of our meeting. The three thought of more features for the
                    application and came up with the structure of how the
                    application should look and what it should do, and spoke
                    about what the group would need to research to make the
                    application feasible. These features were divided among the
                    group at the next formal meeting, requiring all members to
                    write up detailed descriptions and look into how adding
                    these features would be implemented.

                    From the input of all group members, all application
                    features were decided upon. The most prominent features were
                    track recording options, social profiles and forums, and map
                    feature integration with relative aspects of the
                    application. These features were written up by all team
                    members, with those who were stronger in technical knowledge
                    (Blayne, Michelle, Jake) focusing on this, while others
                    stronger in idea development (Charlie, Burak, Helia) focused
                    on other sections of the report.

                    Assignment 2 was finished with a fantastic writeup of the
                    applications proposed features as well as research on the
                    legal and hosting sides of the application, with appropriate
                    reports.

                    Assignment 3 began with the loss of one team member, which
                    did not phase the rest of the group too much. Expansion on
                    existing features and addition to new features of the
                    application were discussed with the group in our first two
                    meetings. Beginning development was also discussed, with
                    Kivy being a suggested appropriate language to code with. An
                    artifact list was made, where we decided on as many as we
                    were comfortable offering with the time and team that we
                    had. These consisted of coding some basic screens for the
                    application, a website to promote the application, posters
                    for marketing, and wireframes for the application.

                    In the third week of Assignment 3, the loss of two more
                    members on the same day shocked what remained of the group;
                    Michelle, Helia and Blayne. With roughly a quarter of the
                    application report written up and no artifacts produced, the
                    remainder still believed that the application could be
                    planned to the expected standards for the assignment.

                  <span>
                    It is worth noting that the three team members powered
                    ahead, producing not only the original 4 artifacts towards
                    the application, but another 7. These consisted of various
                    marketing concepts, many wireframes for the application and
                    its website, the website itself, the app-flow and design for
                    each screen. The three of us had a lot of fun being more
                    creative with our artifacts versus struggling to produce
                    sufficient enough code with poor previous coding skills, so
                    coding was kept as the last priority; however still a main
                    one. Aiming to deliver the more realistically achievable
                    artifacts first was a good decision so we did not get stuck
                    on a single artifact for too long.

                    For the coding of the application, learning Kivy was deemed
                    to be more difficult than the team originally thought, being
                    quite a slow process to produce even the first functioning
                    screen. The inclusion of Kivy Garden, a hub for various Kivy
                    modules, was planned to be utilised for the import of a
                    custom maps module. However, unfortunately not enough
                    progress was made beyond very simple interface coding.

                    Java was considered as the main language to code the
                    application with, however our collective knowledge of Java
                    is not optimal for the scope we are aiming to achieve.

                    When discussing how our application should be presented in a
                    media setting, the group settled on a podcast, with custom
                    animations and voiceovers. We drew up storyboards of how the
                    presentation would be animated, and wrote a rough script.
                    Michelle then had the idea to create versions of us in the
                    Sims 4 and record that instead, as we all agreed animating
                    the vision that we had would be difficult to achieve with
                    our very limited animation skills within the short amount of
                    time before the project due date. So the group then recorded
                    our podcast audio which was layered over Sims 4 gameplay
                    video.

                    We will not be assigning specific roles to our members as we
                    all work collaboratively most of the time or in one on one
                    sessions, as well as help out each other with assigned
                    sections - meaning none of us ‘stick to our lane’. We are
                    all helpful when we can be and this works well within our
                    team. We saw that this helped with members who have busier

                    helping them not feel so behind or stressed out due to the
                    number of sections they have or haven&apos;t completed. We
                    feel like this helped us achieve our absolute best in
                    Assignment 2, and plan on continuing this process in
                    Assignment 3, even more so now that three of our members
                    have decided to quit the course and we are just a three-man
                    group. We believe that there is no point in changing a
                    system that already works, and we do not need to identify
                    roles to feel like we contribute well to a team. We prefer
                    feeling like a unit, rather than a bunch of people sticking
                    to their assigned tasks.

                    We came into Assignment 3 with idealistic views, expecting
                    to deliver as many artifacts towards the project as
                    possible. However along the way we realised that with 3 of
                    our group members dropping out of the course, some of our
                    expectations were not going to be met as perfectly as we set
                    them out to be. One of our most difficult challenges so far
                    has been coding, as we only have 3 members and not all of
                    experience or background in coding. In the beginning of A3
                    we assumed that it would be easier to code most of the
                    application, but with the shortages of members and our
                    limited knowledge, it became clear that we were looking at
                    maybe only a couple pages of the application to be coded. We
                    believe if we had six people like we originally were meant
                    to, the coding aspect could have been a lot smoother for us
                    and we could have delivered a higher quality coding
                    artifact.

                    Knowing that we were going to be struggling with this
                    artifact, we jumped heavily into producing other, more
                    creative artifacts. This includes a fully researched
                    marketing plan, along with a time schedule for our social
                    media accounts to gain the most engagement to further our
                    potential applications growth. We have designed a marketing
                    poster along with icons and a mockup application. We also
                    decided that wireframes are a straightforward and simple way
                    of showing a great example of how our application could be
                    developed for users. They show every aspect of the
                    application from start to finish in a methodical manner,
                    with attached descriptions for each screen/option. We
                    created both a wireframe for both the application, and the
                    applications theoretical website. We chose to produce the
                    website for the applications advertisement to show yet
                    another way that we would handle the applications production
                    lifespan.

                    showing our research and understanding of legal
                    considerations for an application such as Traqstarz, both
                    within Australia and world wide. This was fairly
                    straightforward to produce, with the use of a legal document
                    generator and the cookie policy being a version of
                    Twitter’s, altered to reflect ‘Traqstarz’. All of this has
                    been thoroughly cited as well!

                    Some things that were impossible to deliver were pulling
                    telemetry data from phones, due to our limited set of
                    knowledge and skills. We were also unable to deliver storage
                    of data due to us not having enough knowledge and experience
                    with Google Firebase, as that is where we intended to host
                    the application. The last thing that we were unable to due
                    to the limited time and members was testing the application,
                    as mentioned before this would require coding the
                    application to its entirety which we were not able to
                    achieve.

                    We decided to produce as much as we can in the limited time
                    available and evenly divide our dedication on all parts of
                    the assignment to deliver an outcome we are satisfied with.
                    Although we felt more like a marketing team to our
                    application than the developers, we tried our absolute best
                    in the areas that we knew we would achieve the most success
                    within the set timeframe.

                    Kivy was suggested in the beginning by Blayne as it is
                    mainly used for Android app development. Unfortunately
                    whilst installing Kivy we came across a few technical issues
                    which we could not resolve due to our limited set of skills
                    and knowledge. After 2 hours of trying to install Kivy on
                    PyCharm we finally decided to move on and use Visual Studio.
                    We thought that Kivy was difficult to understand due to its
                    limited documentation, however once googling how other
                    people have approached application development using Kivy,
                    it became a little easier to grasp.

                    We chose Python because Michelle and Blayne had some
                    knowledge about it since they were in programming, but for
                    Helia it was a bit more difficult to get comfortable with
                    Python since she has had no experience with it. Luckily
                    Blayne and Michelle had enough knowledge about Python and
                    guided Helia step by step, from how to download the program
                    , how to access the program and lastly how to do basic
                    coding. As Intro to Programming teaches us the basics, we
                    felt more than capable in producing something using Python.
                    In closing though, we realised just how hard it actually can
                    be and we definitely underestimated the difficulty and need
                    more experience and knowledge before we could ever
                    realistically produce an application.

                    PyCharm was offered by Blayne as an alternative to the
                    Python IDE as it has an updated and modern text editor, and
                    support for plugins for easy importation of Kivy modules.
                    This program was downloaded by each member and we began by
                    attempting to write a program using Kivy. This proved to be
                    difficult as attempting to set Pycharms path variables to
                    use both Kivy and Python was not going well. We spent 3
                    hours on this task, with team members achieving differing
                    success at differing points of install.

                    We approached the use of the PyCharm interpreter with a
                    mindset of how simple and straightforward it would be, but
                    ditched the idea to utilise Visual Studio Code when it
                    became too problematic.

                    Visual Studio Code was offered as an alternative to the
                    PyCharm idea by Michelle, as she had experience in using
                    VSC. She discovered that it had Kivy plugin support as well
                    as many other related quality of life plugins. Immediately
                    we were able to successfully test an example Kivy
                    application of a simple button with no problems. VSC also
                    includes a Live Sharing plugin, allowing users to
                    collaborate in real time on the same document of code. This
                    allowed Blayne and Michelle to offer Helia some support in
                    learning Python + Kivy, as well as offer insight into each
                    other’s coding efforts.

                    Initially we chose to use Google Firebase to host and
                    develop our application as we thought it would be easy to
                    have it all in the one location, however this would require
                    everyone to learn Java in just about 4 weeks - which is a
                    ridiculous ask. Also, we did not really understand how to
                    set up a server or store credentials - therefore utilising
                    Google Firebase wasn’t going to realistically happen, so we
                    went ahead and used Kivy in Visual Studio Code to create
                    what we could of our application. Google Firebase is still
                    the hypothetical host for our application, at least until
                    the application ever became big enough that we were blowing
                    past Google’s free limitation plan. In closing, our idea was
                    solid but due to our experience and knowledge of developing
                    applications, we failed to execute it.

                    Our application will be tested during all stages of
                    development. In early stages, mock data will be created to
                    simulate sessions so the application can demonstrate its
                    current stage ability to perform. This will help us see
                    where we are going right and what we are doing wrong along
                    the way. Further into the development process, as builds are
                    being considered pre-release rather than alpha builds, the
                    application will be able to be utilised on a phone. This can
                    be taken into a real time setting to observe the performance
                    and viability of certain features. All testing will be
                    performed by our developers, and hired testers will not be
                    required for such a small case application. We will strive
                    to present an application that is completely built and bug
                    free to ensure the best experience for those who use our
                    application. We will know our application no longer needs
                    testing and is ready for publishing when we can successfully
                    showcase all of our intended features with no noticeable

                    Some risks that we noticed upfront was our use of Kivy, as
                    it is a python module that we don’t understand quite well,
                    on top of the fact none of us have a heavy background in
                    coding and are currently learning basic Python in Intro to
                    Programming. Going in depth into this risk, we do not
                    currently know how to do anything in Kivy – when we first
                    installed it, it took us 2 hours to do so while we were
                    collaborating. After research, we have a general idea of how
                    most of our features can be implemented, but that doesn’t
                    mean that we will be experienced enough to understand how to
                    do that. As all of our features heavily rely on Kivy/Python,
                    the biggest risk of our application is us not understanding
                    Kivy/Python well enough.

                    Another similar risk is the team&apos;s comfort and
                    knowledge around specifically Android based operating
                    systems. Pulling data from phone sensors requires specific
                    knowledge on how to navigate android directories and find
                    sensor data. Sensors may also be locked behind root access
                    to the phone, requiring us to be comfortable in gaining
                    access to root partitions within the phone and how to access
                    the sensors for their raw data. Rooting in Android can be a
                    simple process to some, however to those who have not read
                    forums and guides on this may struggle using required
                    software or command line interfaces to do this.

                    As we do not have precise knowledge on all laws governing
                    data collection specific to every country, there is a chance
                    that some of these laws may be accidentally breached when a
                    user uses our application. We also have no experience with
                    data pulling or storing so have no general idea of how much
                    storage we would be requiring to utilise this data.

                    Our group communicates via our group chat that we made on
                    Microsoft Teams. We talk quite often in the group chat as we
                    all feel like friends in such a short amount of time and
                    enjoy being engaged in each other&apos;s lives. We schedule
                    two meetings a week on Microsoft Teams that are held on
                    Wednesday and Sunday; with every second Sunday’s meeting
                    being pushed to Monday to allocate for work schedules
                    changing. Outside of our scheduled meetings, if we feel like
                    we need an extra catch up to be more efficient in our
                    progress we usually book another meeting for Fridays during
                    the daytime. As we get closer to the submission date we have
                    a plan ready to enable efficiency as well as help each other
                    stick to deadlines. We plan to have more meetings and
                    require daily check-ins, even if it’s just to say “I was too
                    busy to do anything today, tomorrow I will continue my
                    section.” By implementing this plan we hope to overcome the
                    problem we had last assignment, which was the failure to
                    adhere to deadlines and people feeling stressed out with
                    their busy lives on top of modules and doing the assignment.
                    During Assignment 2 we did experience group members not
                    responding to communication and in the next group meeting,
                    we brought up the issue with them and asked for an
                    improvement, afterwards we were shown that our feedback was
                    taken into account and the effort to solve the problem was
                    properly applied. During Assignment 3 we experienced a
                    member leaving and another one not responding to any
                    messages. So we reached out to Anthony and Luka, to attempt
                    to see if they could push the member to speak. This had an
                    odd effect of making another member leave, along with the
                    non communication member finally speaking up that he too,
                    was leaving. So we were left as a three man group within
                    under a week. Despite that though, us three remaining feel
                    that we did the best we could in terms of attempting to get
                    a clear picture of what was going on and how we were
                    progressing forward as a team for A3 and A5. Overall, we
                    feel that the remaining three of us are very transparent
                    with each other in both our communications and efforts shown
                    via collaboration with each other and contributions to the
                    team.
