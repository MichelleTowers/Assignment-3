                  Blayne was born late 1995 in a small country NSW town called
                  Deniliquin. He lived there spending alternating weeks with his
                  split parents until he had to decide to live with one or the
                  other at the age of 11, as his father was moving towns to
                  pursue career and other relationships. Blayne made the
                  decision to live with his father which involved relocating to
                  the central NSW town of Wagga Wagga. He completed his higher
                  education in year 12, graduating in 2013. His senior years of
                  high school were when he discovered his passion for mechanics
                  and computer technologies. These interests involved building
                  his first computer as well as installing sound systems in cars
                  of his own and friends. He had a part time job working in the
                  bakery department at Coles supermarkets which helped fund his
                  hobbies.

                <br />
                <span>
                  After high school Blayne went straight in to a Bachelor of
                  Medical Radiation Science at the local Charles Sturt
                  University, following in his fathers footsteps as a clinical
                  radiographer. Four years of the course were completed before
                  some mental and family challenges occurred, leading to failure
                  of many subjects and complete loss of motivation to continue
                  the course. Blayne made a decision to move with his
                  girlfriend, who he had met in his first year of university, to
                  the Hunter Valley region north of Sydney. He got a part time
                  job filling shelves at a Coles supermarket, and spent 2 years
                  enjoying his free time playing games, working, going to the
                  gym, snowboarding, modifying his cars and developing his
                  relationship. He stepped up into a department manager role at
                  Coles, managing the Bakery with his previous years experience,
                  where he performed extremely well. However, after another 2
                  years the workload became overwhelming, leading to his pursuit
                  of a different career entirely.

                <br />
                <span>
                  Blayne’s decision to step down from management, and begin a
                  bachelor of IT online at RMIT came from looking at the stars
                  while lying in a hammock on new year&apos;s eve 2021. He
                  thought to himself that for all the vastness of the universe,
                  there was an opportunity for him to do something worthwhile,
                  and his driving goal was to help humanity explore the stars.
                  He considered his choice in educational courses a stepping
                  stone towards developing a great career in IT and perhaps
                  eventually space exploration.

                  Blayne had an interest in pursuing a future field in
                  Artificial Intelligence, and so chose to complete future
                  skills short courses at RMIT Online. These were:

                <br />
                <span>- AI Programming with Python</span>

                <br />
                <span>
                  As he was looking to eventually have an AI + space themed

                  (Astronomy) through Swinburne University of Technology.

                  As he had worked for Coles Supermarkets for 15 years prior,
                  both part time and full time with experience in department
                  management, he was able to use this to his advantage in
                  applying for relevant jobs with the company. He began a
                  full-time corporate position at Coles in Store Support as an
                  Associate Software Engineer. He used this as an opportunity to
                  further build his knowledge in Java, and Cloud and
                  Infrastructure technologies.

                  Blayne applied for and was accepted as a Machine Learning
                  Intern for an online customer service company called ZenDesk.
                  He had to relocate to a remote location in Victoria where he
                  refined and applied his machine learning knowledge from
                  experimental design to scalable infrastructure production.

                <br />
                <span>
                  Blayne acquired a full-time position as a Data scientist for
                  the company Wesfarmers, allowing him to demonstrate his
                  knowledge of Data Science, Python Programming, Mathematics and
                  statistics, and deep learning frameworks.

                  After much debate with himself, Blayne applied for and was
                  accepted into a full time position as a Data Engineer for
                  Starlink at SpaceX. This required a relocation to Redmond, WA,
                  USA. This position was the perfect job for Blayne, allowing
                  him to work with machine learning and data analysis,
                  accompanied with his keen interest in space and the future
                  that would be paved with technology engineered and deployed by
                  SpaceX. Blayne’s previous qualifications from RMIT, machine
                  learning internships, and programming language knowledge fit
                  the criteria for the job requirements perfectly.

                  Blayne was promoted to Sr. Data Engineer for Starlink at
                  SpaceX. He continued in this field for 20 years with a year
                  off to visit his family in Australia. He retired at the age of
                  69.

                  In Blayne’s retirement, he occasionally rode his motorbikes on
                  casual trips around his hometown. With an invitation from some
                  of his longest friends, he made the decision to take part in a
                  recreational ride day. He took his old race bike out of
                  storage and loaded up an old application he had created with
                  his favourite group back in his early university days.

                  Leading into A3, I was aware of how members of our group acted
                  and worked around each other. I was confident in the ability
                  for us as a group of five to achieve an extraordinary mark.
                  When two group members dropped , leaving us with 3/6, the
                  remaining 3 attempted to keep high spirits and confidence, but
                  I could tell that we all felt a little bit overwhelmed and
                  unsure. We definitely had doubts about achieving the amount of
                  work that we would have liked with a full group, however we
                  strived to contribute the best quality work we could. After
                  the group split, I was surprised at how much closer I feel
                  that I got with the other two in the group, Helia and
                  Michelle. The group&apos;s formality dropped a little bit, as
                  we committed to meeting more often under casual circumstances
                  and chatting away while we collaborated on joint
                  documents/artifacts. Looking back to the beginning of our
                  group projects, my hesitancy towards group work has nearly
                  disappeared due to the ease of working alongside Helia and
                  Michelle. I’m happy to say that I’ve genuinely enjoyed the
                  time that I’ve had to spend with these guys and hope to keep
                  learning with them over the course and into the future.
