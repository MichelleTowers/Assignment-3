                  Helia was born on the 19th of April 2000 in a small city in
                  Iran. At the age of nine her mother decided to continue
                  studying abroad, in 2009 Helia and her Mother moved to
                  Malaysia and lived there for 4 years. After returning to Iran
                  Helia’s Mother decided to travel to Australia to create a
                  better future for her daughter. In 2014 Helia and her family
                  moved to Australia. Fitting in was one of Helia’s biggest
                  challenges in the beginning of her life in Australia, She was
                  quite different from the other kids and at the time english
                  wasn&apos;t her strongest skills, she felt alone and left out
                  most of the time, but with time she found some amazing friends
                  and finally felt at home in Australia. She had made some great
                  memories that she never forgot. Her passion for IT had stemmed
                  from her Mother, she has always been around new technology and
                  watching her mother code made her really excited. After
                  graduating high school Helia took on a full time role in a
                  recruitment company focusing solely on IT roles, after working
                  in the IT recruitment industry Helia finally made the decision
                  to take it upon herself and start a new journey in her life by
                  studying her Bachelors in IT.

                  Whilst studying for her bachelor’s Helia also took on learning
                  a new language, Arabic, she already was fluent in Persian and
                  English but learning a new language was a very beneficial
                  skill for her. She continued working as a full-time recruiter
                  and studying at the same time. She graduated from her Bachelor
                  of Information Technology in March 2025, after graduating she
                  applied for her master’s in cyber security at the UNSW
                  Canberra Campus. She shortly applied for the Technologist
                  Graduate program at the ASIO. She made the decision to move
                  states from Sydney to Canberra as her university and desired
                  job was going to be based there.

                  Moving to Canberra was one of the best decisions Helia had
                  made career wise, getting into the Technologist Graduate
                  program really set out a clear career path for Helia at the
                  time. After completing her 12 months training program, Helia
                  got hired at the ASIO to work as a Junior Cyber Security
                  analyst working in a small dynamic team, this opportunity
                  helped Helia gain the experience needed for her career whilst
                  also studying for her master’s in cyber security. Helia worked
                  as a Junior Cyber Security Analyst and after 3 years once her
                  master’s degree was completed, she got promoted to a Senior
                  Cyber Threat Hunter role within the ASIO. Whilst working as A
                  Senior Cyber Threat Hunter Helia also invested her time to
                  learn more skills such as Martial Arts (Brazilian jiu jitsu)
                  and Learnt Mandarin to advance the chances of her application
                  for the Intelligent Officer Opportunity.

                  After 72 years of working in Australia, Helia was sent
                  overseas to middle east to undergo undercover and give intel
                  from the inside of one the biggest terrorist groups in the
                  world. As her work in Australia needed more intel from the
                  inside of said Terrorist group. The reason she was sent to the
                  Middle East was because of her cultural background and her
                  fluency in Arabic which made her the perfect candidate for
                  this case.

                <span>
                  Once arrived in the middle east Helia had to move tacitly to
                  not raise suspicion, since she was a woman, her being able to
                  get into the terrorist group would be more difficult as it
                  mainly male dominated. Her 10 years of being in the middle
                  east were incredibly impactful, she was able to provide
                  important intel consistently which have led to stop many
                  attacks within the middle east and Australia, Helia also
                  helped many women and children that were forcefully involved
                  with the terrorist group to successfully escape and seek
                  shelter in different countries, overall, she had stopped 15
                  attacks and helped escaped over 200 women and kids.

                  Australia in Canberra. She had a true passion for what she did

                  always recognised and praised. She set a great example for

                  In the beginning of A3 I was excited, but with 3 members
                  dropping out of the course it did cause me to stress out a
                  little bit, but thinking about how well Michelle, Blayne and I
                  worked together on A2 all my worries went away. We worked
                  incredibly well together and everything was done and delivered
                  either on time or earlier, we did not have any specific roles
                  within this assignment we all helped each other out with
                  everything. One surprising thing that happened during this
                  assignment was three members dropping out of the course, but
                  with that happening the way we worked became at a much quicker
                  pace and the formality had completely dropped as we have made
                  a genuine connection over the period of this course and have
                  become good friends. I can’t really think of any improvements
                  as our previous concerns were solved once the other members
                  dropped out of the course. What went really well is the
                  connection I have made with Michelle and Blayne as not only
                  classmates but as really close friends. Working on an
                  assignment with people who you actually enjoy spending time
                  with really impacts the outcome. So far this has been the best
                  group I have ever been with and I wouldn&apos;t change
                  anything about us. I’m really thankful to both Michelle and
                  Blayne for being so amazing and supportive over the period of
                  this course.
